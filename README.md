# Healthcare Recommendation System

This project aims to develop a healthcare recommendation system powered by AI to assist users in finding relevant doctors based on their symptoms and preferences. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost and Random Forest to analyze symptom data and predict potential diseases. By leveraging healthcare provider databases and user ratings, the system recommends doctors with matching specialties and aligned schedules, ensuring personalized and timely medical advice.

## Problem Statement

During challenging situations such as lockdowns, accessing appropriate medical care can be difficult. This project addresses this issue by providing users with personalized doctor recommendations based on their symptoms and preferences. By leveraging AI and healthcare data, the system aims to improve healthcare access and facilitate better health outcomes for users.

## Design Idea and Approach

### Technologies Used:
