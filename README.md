Healthcare Recommendation System
This project aims to develop a healthcare recommendation system powered by AI to assist users in finding relevant doctors based on their symptoms and preferences. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost and Random Forest to analyze symptom data and predict potential diseases. By leveraging healthcare provider databases and user ratings, the system recommends doctors with matching specialties and aligned schedules, ensuring personalized and timely medical advice.
